+
+ Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+ of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
+ as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
+ the version number 2.1.]
+
+                            Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
+free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
+
+  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
+specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
+Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
+can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
+this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
+strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
+below.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
+not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
+you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
+for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
+it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
+it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
+these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
+rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
+you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
+you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
+code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
+complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
+with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
+it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
+library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
+permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
+
+  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
+there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
+modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
+that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
+author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
+introduced by others.
+
+  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
+any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
+effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
+restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
+any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
+consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
+
+  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
+ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
+General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
+is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
+this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
+libraries into non-free programs.
+
+  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
+a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
+combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
+General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
+entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
+Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
+the library.
+
+  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
+does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
+Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
+of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
+are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
+libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
+special circumstances.
+
+  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
+encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
+becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must
+be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
+library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
+case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
+software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
+
+  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
+programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
+free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
+non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
+operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
+system.
+
+  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
+users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
+linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
+that program using a modified version of the Library.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
+"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
+former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
+be combined with the library in order to run.
+
+                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
+program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
+other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
+this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
+Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
+prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
+(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
+
+  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
+which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
+Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
+copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
+portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
+straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
+included without limitation in the term "modification".)
+
+  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
+all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
+interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
+compilation and installation of the library.
+
+  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
+such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
+on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
+writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
+and what the program that uses the Library does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
+complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
+you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
+appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
+all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
+warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
+Library.
+
+  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
+and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
+fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
+
+    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
+    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
+    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
+    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
+    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
+    in the event an application does not supply such function or
+    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
+    its purpose remains meaningful.
+
+    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
+    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
+    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
+    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
+    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
+    root function must still compute square roots.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
+it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Library.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
+with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
+License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
+this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
+that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
+instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
+ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
+that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
+these notices.
+
+  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
+that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
+subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
+
+  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
+the Library into a program that is not a library.
+
+  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
+derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
+under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
+it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
+must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
+medium customarily used for software interchange.
+
+  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
+source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
+distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
+Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
+linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
+work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
+therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
+
+  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
+creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
+contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
+library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
+Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
+
+  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
+that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
+derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
+Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
+linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
+threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
+
+  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
+structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
+functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
+file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
+work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
+Library will still fall under Section 6.)
+
+  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
+distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
+Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
+whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
+
+  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
+link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
+work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
+under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
+modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
+engineering for debugging such modifications.
+
+  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
+Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
+this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
+during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
+copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
+directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
+of these things:
+
+    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
+    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
+    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
+    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
+    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
+    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
+    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
+    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
+    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
+    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
+    to use the modified definitions.)
+
+    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
+    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
+    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
+    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
+    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
+    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
+    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
+
+    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
+    three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
+    Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
+    performing this distribution.
+
+    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
+    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
+    specified materials from the same place.
+
+    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
+    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
+
+  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
+Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
+reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
+the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
+the executable.
+
+  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
+restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
+accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
+use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
+distribute.
+
+  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
+Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
+facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
+library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
+the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
+permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
+
+    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
+    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
+    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
+    Sections above.
+
+    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
+    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
+    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
+
+  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
+the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
+attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
+distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
+rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
+or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
+terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Library or works based on it.
+
+  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
+Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
+subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
+this License.
+
+  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
+countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
+Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
+but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
+"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
+license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
+the Free Software Foundation.
+
+  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
+write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
+copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
+Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
+decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
+of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
+and reuse of software generally.
+
+                            NO WARRANTY
+
+  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
+KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
+IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
+PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
+LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
+THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
+FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
+CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
+LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
+RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
+FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
+SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
+DAMAGES.
+
+                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
+
+  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
+everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
+redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
+of the ordinary General Public License).
+
+  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
+It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
+effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
+have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
+notice is found.
+
+
+    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
+    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
+    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
+    Lesser General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
+    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
+your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
+if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
+  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
+  Random Hacker.

-Common Public License version 1.0 
----------------------------------
-
-THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC 
-LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM 
-CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
-
-1. DEFINITIONS 
-
-"Contribution" means: 
-
-a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
-   distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent 
-   Contributor: 
-
-i) changes to the Program, and 
-
-ii) additions to the Program; 
-
-where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are 
-distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a 
-Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone 
-acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to 
-the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in 
-conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
-not derivative works of the Program. 
-
-"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program. 
-
-"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
-necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when 
-combined with the Program. 
-
-"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-
-"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, 
-including all Contributors. 
-
-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS 
-
-a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to 
-reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
-distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
-such derivative works, in source code and object code form. 
-
-b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants 
-Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
-Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
-transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
-object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
-Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
-Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
-covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
-other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
-licensed hereunder.
-
-c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to 
-its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any 
-Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual 
-property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
-to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of 
-intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the 
-rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole 
-responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. 
-For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to 
-distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
-license before distributing the Program. 
-
-d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
-copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
-set forth in this Agreement. 
-
-3. REQUIREMENTS 
-
-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
-its own license agreement, provided that: 
-
-a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and 
-
-b) its license agreement: 
-
-i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and 
-conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
-and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
-and fitness for a particular purpose; 
-
-ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
-damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
-damages, such as lost profits; 
-
-iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by 
-that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and 
-
-iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, 
-and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a 
-medium customarily used for software exchange. 
-
-When the Program is made available in source code form: 
-
-a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
-
-b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
-
-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the 
-Program. 
-
-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if 
-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the 
-originator of the Contribution. 
-
-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
-
-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with 
-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is 
-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who 
-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if 
-a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such 
-Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify 
-every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages 
-and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal 
-actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the 
-extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in 
-connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
-offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
-to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
-Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
-to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
-any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
-participate in any such claim at its own expense. 
-
-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product 
-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that 
-Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties 
-related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such 
-Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the 
-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other 
-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court 
-requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial 
-Contributor must pay those damages. 
-
-5. NO WARRANTY 
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON
-AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
-OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
-TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
-Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
-using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
-exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks
-and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss
-of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
-operations. 
-
-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST 
-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, 
-STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
-WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
-GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
-
-7. GENERAL 
-
-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable 
-law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the 
-terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such 
-provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such 
-provision valid and enforceable. 
-
-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to 
-a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
-lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
-Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
-is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
-entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
-Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
-hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
-granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
-filed. 
-
-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to 
-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does 
-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of 
-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, 
-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as 
-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement 
-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
-and survive. 
-
-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in 
-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be 
-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to 
-publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. 
-No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. 
-IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to
-serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
-of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
-(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of
-the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
-the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
-(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
-stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
-licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
-whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
-Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. 
-
-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the 
-intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this 
-Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year 
-after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
-in any resulting litigation. 
-
-Special exception for LZMA compression module

-NSIS, expressly permit you to statically or dynamically link your code (or bind 
-by name) to the files from the LZMA compression module for NSIS without 
-subjecting your linked code to the terms of the Common Public license version
-1.0.  Any modifications or additions to files from the LZMA compression module
-for NSIS, however, are subject to the terms of the Common Public License
-version 1.0.

+
+Mon Feb 11 18:19:48 CET 2008 (acab)
+-----------------------------------
+  * WARNING: NEW LOGIC IN SCAN LIMITS
+    The logic in the scanner limits have been reworked. This results in
+    different command line options to clamscan, different config options to
+    clamd and, overall, a different behaviour.
+    I repeat: SOME THINGS HAVE CHANGED, BE CAREFUL!
+    At the moment this is a work in progress. Final version will be available

+
+Mon Feb 11 18:33:22 EET 2008 (edwin)
+------------------------------------

+			     included;
+			     include <sys/select.h> only if needed for fd_set
+			     (bb #452)
+			     
+Fri Feb  8 20:16:45 CET 2008 (tk)

+
+Thu Feb  7 22:30:51 EET 2008 (edwin)
+------------------------------------
+  * clamd: (bb #803)
+	* don't ignore SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, and SIGSEGV. 
+	  POSIX says the behaviour is undefined if they are ignored.
+	  (on HP-UX behaviour was: hang)
+	* make BIGSTACK the default on HPUX 
+
+Wed Feb  6 21:30:55 CET 2008 (tk)
+---------------------------------
+  * libclamav/regex_list.c: compatibility with new matcher extension
+
+Wed Feb  6 20:36:05 EET 2008 (edwin)
+------------------------------------
+  * contrib/entitynorm/, libclamav/hashtab.[ch], readdb.c, matcher.h, entitylist.h, encoding_aliases.h:
+	* introduce hashset_* functions
+	* use a faster hash function
+	* use hashset to load mdb signatures to optimize DB load time

+
+Sun Feb  3 21:23:01 EET 2008 (edwin)
+------------------------------------
+  * clamav-milter: use cli_ctime()
+
+Sun Feb  3 21:04:54 EET 2008 (edwin)
+---------------------------------
+  * libclamav/others.[ch]: introduce cli_ctime() that uses ctime_r() when
+		available, and falls back to locking with a mutex around
+		ctime(). (ensures we are using the same mutex always).
+  * clamd, shared: use cli_ctime() instead of the thread-unsafe ctime().
+		This fixes stability problems.
+
+Sun Feb  3 19:13:43 CET 2008 (tk)

+

+------------------------------------
+  * libclamav/filetypes.c: use entconv to detect UTF-16BE, and UCS-4 variants
+  * libclamav/htmlnorm.c: use only cli_readline() we don't need exact
+  conversion
+  * libclamav/entconv.c:
+	* drop unused functions,
+  	* simplify encoding_norm_readline(), and rename to encoding_normalize_toascii()
+
+Fri Feb  1 00:58:05 CET 2008 (tk)
+---------------------------------

+------------------------------------

 -------
 
-This release fixes various bugs in libclamav, freshclam and clamav-milter,
-and adds support for PUA (Potentially Unwanted Application) signatures
-(clamscan: --detect-pua, clamd: DetectPUA).
-
-** Announcement **
-
-Dear ClamAV users,
-
-On August 17, Sourcefire, the creators of Snort, acquired the ClamAV project.
-The full announcement is available here:
-
-http://www.sourcefire.com/products/clamav/
-
-We'd like to thank everyone in the ClamAV community for their dedication to
-the project. The acquisition by Sourcefire is a testament to the hard work of
-the entire ClamAV community in developing cutting edge technology that truly
-showcases the promise of the open source model. With the additional resources
-Sourcefire will provide we look forward to working with the community to
-continue the advancement of ClamAV.
-
-Sourcefire now owns ClamAV project and related trademarks, as well as the
-source code copyrights held by the five principal members of the ClamAV team.
-Sourcefire will also assume control of the ClamAV project including: the
-ClamAV.org domain, web site and web site content; and the ClamAV Sourceforge
-project page.
-
-What's most important is that from the end-user perspective very little will
-change beyond the additional resources Sourcefire will provide in our
-continued efforts to advance the ClamAV technology and improve our ability to
-interact with the open source community. The core team will continue to lead
-the advancement of ClamAV and the CVD as employees of Sourcefire. Both the
-ClamAV engine and the signature database will remain under GPL.
-
-For more information please visit our website and the following FAQ page:
-
-http://www.clamav.net/support/sf-faq
+This release introduces many new features and engine enhancements, please
+see the notes below for the list of major changes. The most visible one
+is the new logic in scan limits which affects some command line and config
+options of clamscan and clamd. Please see clamscan(1) and clamd.conf(5)
+and the example config file for more information on the new options.
+
+Most important changes include:
+
+  * libclamav:
+    - New logic in scan limits: provides much more efficient protection against
+      DoS attacks but also results in different command line and config options
+      to clamscan and clamd (see below)
+    - New/improved modules: unzip, SIS, cabinet, CHM, SZDD, text normalisator,
+      entity converter
+    - Improved filetype detection; filetype definitions can be remotely updated
+    - Support for .cld containers (which replace .inc directories)
+    - Improved pattern matcher and signature formats
+    - More efficient scanning of HTML files
+    - Many other improvements
+
+  * clamd:
+    - NEW CONFIG FILE OPTIONS: MaxScanSize, MaxFileSize, MaxRecursion, MaxFiles
+    - ** THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED **: MailMaxRecursion,
+      ArchiveMaxFileSize, ArchiveMaxRecursion, ArchiveMaxFiles,
+      ArchiveMaxCompressionRatio, ArchiveBlockMax
+
+  * clamscan:
+    - NEW CMDLINE OPTIONS: --max-filesize, --max-scansize
+    - REMOVED OPTIONS: --block-max, --max-space, --max-ratio
+
+  * freshclam:
+    - NEW CONFIG OPTION CompressLocalDatabase
+    - NEW CMDLINE SWITCH --no-warnings
+    - main.inc and daily.inc directories are no longer used by ClamAV; please
+      remove them manually from your database directory

+0.92
+----
+
+This release provides various bugfixes, optimisations and improvements
+to the scanning engine. The new features include support for ARJ and
+SFX-ARJ archives, AutoIt, basic SPF parser in clamav-milter (to reduce
+phishing false-positives), faster scanning and others (see ChangeLog).
+To get a consistent behaviour of the anti-phishing module on all platforms,
+libclamav now includes the regex library from OpenBSD.

-dnl @synopsis AC_CREATE_TARGET_H [(HEADER-FILE [,PREFIX)]
-dnl
-dnl create the header-file and let it contain '#defines'
-dnl for the target platform. This macro is used for libraries
-dnl that have platform-specific quirks. Instead of inventing a
-dnl target-specific target.h.in files, just let it create a
-dnl header file from the definitions of AC_CANONICAL_SYSTEM
-dnl and put only ifdef's in the installed header-files.
-dnl
-dnl if the HEADER-FILE is absent, [target.h] is used.
-dnl if the PREFIX is absent, [TARGET] is used. 
-dnl the prefix can be the packagename. (y:a-z-:A-Z_:)
-dnl
-dnl the defines look like...
-dnl
-dnl #ifndef TARGET_CPU_M68K
-dnl #define TARGET_CPU_M68K "m68k"
-dnl #endif
-dnl
-dnl #ifndef TARGET_OS_LINUX
-dnl #define TARGET_OS_LINUX "linux-gnu"
-dnl #endif
-dnl
-dnl #ifndef TARGET_OS_TYPE                     /* the string itself */
-dnl #define TARGET_OS_TYPE "linux-gnu"
-dnl #endif
-dnl 
-dnl detail:  in the case of hppa1.1, the three idents "hppa1_1" "hppa1" 
-dnl and "hppa"  are derived, for an m68k it just two, "m68k" and "m"
-dnl
-dnl the CREATE_TARGET_H__ variant is almost the same function, but everything 
-dnl is lowercased instead of uppercased, and there is a "__" in front of
-dnl each prefix, so it looks like...
-dnl 
-dnl #ifndef __target_os_linux
-dnl #define __target_os_linux "linux-gnulibc2"
-dnl #endif
-dnl
-dnl #ifndef __target_os__                     /* the string itself */
-dnl #define __target_os__ "linux-gnulibc2"
-dnl #endif
-dnl
-dnl #ifndef __target_cpu_i586
-dnl #define __target_cpu_i586 "i586"
-dnl #endif
-dnl
-dnl #ifndef __target_arch_i386                
-dnl #define __target_arch_i386 "i386"
-dnl #endif
-dnl
-dnl #ifndef __target_arch__                   /* cpu family arch */
-dnl #define __target_arch__ "i386"
-dnl #endif
-dnl
-dnl other differences: the default string-define is "__" insteadof "_TYPE" 
-dnl
-dnl personally I prefer the second variant (which had been the first in
-dnl the devprocess of this file but I assume people will often fallback
-dnl to the primary variant presented herein).
-dnl
-dnl NOTE: CREATE_TARGET_H does also fill HOST_OS-defines
-dnl functionality has been split over functions called CREATE_TARGET_H_UPPER 
-dnl CREATE_TARGET_H_LOWER CREATE_TARGET_HOST_UPPER CREATE_TARGET_HOST_LOWER
-dnl CREATE_TARGET_H  uses CREATE_TARGET_H_UPPER    CREATE_TARGET_HOST_UPPER
-dnl CREATE_TARGET_H_ uses CREATE_TARGET_H_LOWER    CREATE_TARGET_HOST_LOWER
-dnl
-dnl there is now a CREATE_PREFIX_TARGET_H in this file as a shorthand for
-dnl PREFIX_CONFIG_H from a target.h file, however w/o the target.h ever created
-dnl (the prefix is a bit different, since we add an extra -target- and -host-)

-dnl the instruction set architecture (ISA) has evolved for a small set
-dnl of cpu types. So they often have specific names, e.g. sparclite,
-dnl yet they share quite a few similarities. This macro will set the
-dnl shell-var $target_cpu_arch to the basic type. Note that these
-dnl names are often in conflict with their original 32-bit type name
-dnl of these processors, just use them for directory-handling or add
-dnl a prefix/suffix to distinguish them from $target_cpu
-dnl
-dnl this macros has been invented since config.guess is sometimes
-dnl too specific about the cpu-type. I chose the names along the lines
-dnl of linux/arch/ which is modelled after widespread arch-naming, IMHO.

-dnl @synopsis AC_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF(TYPE [, HEADERS [, EXTRA_SIZES...]])
-dnl
-dnl This macro checks for the size of TYPE using compile checks, not
-dnl run checks. You can supply extra HEADERS to look into. the check
-dnl will cycle through 1 2 4 8 16 and any EXTRA_SIZES the user
-dnl supplies. If a match is found, it will #define SIZEOF_`TYPE' to
-dnl that value. Otherwise it will emit a configure time error
-dnl indicating the size of the type could not be determined.
-dnl
-dnl The trick is that C will not allow duplicate case labels. While
-dnl this is valid C code:
-dnl
-dnl      switch (0) case 0: case 1:;
-dnl
-dnl The following is not:
-dnl
-dnl      switch (0) case 0: case 0:;
-dnl
-dnl Thus, the AC_TRY_COMPILE will fail if the currently tried size
-dnl does not match.
-dnl
-dnl Here is an example skeleton configure.in script, demonstrating the
-dnl macro's usage:
-dnl
-dnl      AC_PROG_CC
-dnl      AC_CHECK_HEADERS(stddef.h unistd.h)

-using Visual Studio 2005, thus avoiding emulation layers such as Cygwin.
-
-Some patches are needed against the rest of CVS for the code to
-compile (most of them are trivial), see clamAV/patches.
-
-You will need to get hold of w32-pthreads version 2.6 from
-http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/.
-
-Thanks to acab@clamav.net for adding libclamav.dll support

-TODO:	Support GMP
-	virusaction is not supported
-	A plugin to MS Exchange
-	On access scanning
-	Investigation of .NET dependencies
-	Scan when a screensaver kicks in
-	zlib and pthreads should be DLL, not bundled into libclamav.dll

- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-			    Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-    parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Program.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-    received the program in object code or executable form with such
-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Program or works based on it.
-
-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-this License.
-
-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-Foundation.
-
-  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-			    NO WARRANTY
-
-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
-    (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-    GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
-    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
-
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
-when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
-be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
-  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
-Public License instead of this License.

-Installation Instructions
-*************************
-
-Copyright (C) 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005,
-2006 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
-
-This file is free documentation; the Free Software Foundation gives
-unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.
-
-Basic Installation
-==================
-
-Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
-configure, build, and install this package.  The following
-more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
-instructions specific to this package.
-
-   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
-various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
-file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
-debugging `configure').
-
-   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
-and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
-the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
-disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
-cache files.
-
-   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
-some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
-may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
-`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
-you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
-of `autoconf'.
-
-The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
-
-     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
-     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
-
-  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
-     the package.
-
-  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.
-
-  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
-     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
-     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
-     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
-     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
-     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
-     with the distribution.
-
-Compilers and Options
-=====================
-
-Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
-`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
-details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
-
-   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
-by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
-is an example:
-
-     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
-
-   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
-
-Compiling For Multiple Architectures
-====================================
-
-You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
-same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
-directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.
-
-   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
-architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
-installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
-reconfiguring for another architecture.
-
-Installation Names
-==================
-
-By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
-`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
-can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
-`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.
-
-   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
-architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
-PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
-
-   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
-options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
-kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
-you can set and what kinds of files go in them.
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
-option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
-
-Optional Features
-=================
-
-Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
-`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
-is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
-`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
-package recognizes.
-
-   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
-find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
-you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
-`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
-
-Specifying the System Type
-==========================
-
-There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
-but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
-Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
-architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
-message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
-`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
-type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
-
-     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
-
-where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
-
-     OS KERNEL-OS
-
-   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
-`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
-need to know the machine type.
-
-   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
-use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
-produce code for.
-
-   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
-platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
-"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
-eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
-
-Sharing Defaults
-================
-
-If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
-can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
-values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
-`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
-`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
-`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
-A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
-
-Defining Variables
-==================
-
-Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
-environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
-configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
-variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
-them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
-
-     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
-
-causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
-overridden in the site shell script).
-
-Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
-an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:
-
-     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
-
-`configure' Invocation
-======================
-
-`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.
-
-`--help'
-`-h'
-     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
-
-`--version'
-`-V'
-     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
-     script, and exit.
-
-`--cache-file=FILE'
-     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
-     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
-     disable caching.
-
-`--config-cache'
-`-C'
-     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
-
-`--quiet'
-`--silent'
-`-q'
-     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
-     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
-     messages will still be shown).
-
-`--srcdir=DIR'
-     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
-     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
-
-`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
-`configure --help' for more details.

-# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
-# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
-# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
-#
-# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
-# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
-# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
-# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
-# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
-# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
-# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
-#
-# $ac_aux_dir/missing
-#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
-# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
-#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
-#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
-#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
-#
-# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
-# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
-# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
-# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
-#
-# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
-# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
-#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
-# and then we would define $MISSING as
-#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
-# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
-# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
-# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
-# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
-#
-# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
-# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
-# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

-Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
-
-To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
-VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
-
-Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
-
-Configuration:
-  -h, --help              display this help and exit
-      --help=short        display options specific to this package
-      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
-  -V, --version           display version information and exit
-  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking...' messages
-      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
-  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
-  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
-      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

-  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
-              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
-  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>

-  CPP         C preprocessor
-  CXX         C++ compiler command
