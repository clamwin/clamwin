## Getting sources

Clone repository using:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/clamwin/clamav-win32.git`

## Notes

- You can store database and config paths in the registry using
  clamav.reg file (I may make a nsis installer in the future).

  If you get SSL Certificates problems when launching **freshclam** you need to install
  [Baltimore CyberTrust Root](https://cacerts.digicert.com/BaltimoreCyberTrustRoot.crt)
  (double click on .crt file and follow the wizard)

  On legacy versions a crt bundle is used instead, if you get a message like:
  `ERROR: Failed to convert system certificate to x509.`
  it's probabily and old bogus cert you can safely remove from windows cert manager,
  on my system `Japan Certification Services, Inc. SecureSign RootCA1, RootCA2 and RootCA3`

## Mini FAQ

Q: freshclam: 403 or Forbidden; Blocked by CDN while trying to update

A: <https://docs.clamav.net/faq/faq-troubleshoot.html#how-do-i-know-if-my-ip-address-has-been-blocked>, often it's enough to delete freshclam.dat in the database directory

## Running Clamd and FreshClam as services

- import `clamav.reg` file
- create `C:\ClamAV` and `C:\ClamAV\db`
- create `C:\ClamAV\certs` and copy `clamav.crt` into it (optional)
- put executables in `C:\ClamAV`
- create freshclam.conf in `C:\ClamAV`
- create clamd.conf in `C:\ClamAV`
- install the service with (in Administrator cmd prompt): `clamd.exe --install`
- launch `freshclam.exe` to download the virus database

freshclam.conf

```text
DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net
DNSDatabaseInfo current.cvd.clamav.net
# Optional explicit cert path (recommended for portable/non-default layouts):
# CVDCertsDirectory "C:\\ClamAV\\certs"
```

clamd.conf

```text
TCPSocket 3310
TCPAddr 127.0.0.1
MaxThreads 2
LogFile C:\ClamAV\clamd.log
DatabaseDirectory C:\ClamAV\db
```

Make sure `C:\Clamav` is writable by the `System Service` user.

Finally start the service with net start clamd
